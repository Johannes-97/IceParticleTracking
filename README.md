# IceParticleTracking
Motion-based multiple-object tracking of ice particles in videos
of propeller ice shedding. The track by detection workflow consists
of an object detector based on OpenCV's mixture of gaussian background subtractor
and a Kalman Filter multiple-object tracker imported from motpy.
The script was developed in Python 3.12
